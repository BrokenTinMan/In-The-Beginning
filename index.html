        Montross Virgina is a quiet town. Known for it's thriving community of 
        
        
        In the summer of 1934, Mildred Fanypants (A.K.A. The Montross Mother)
     was seen taking three young children into the woods.
     <br>
     Witnesses say they saw Fanypants emerge from the woods later that day.
     <br>
    The children were found 2 weeks later, half starved and not all there. 
    <br>
    Fanypants was taken into custody but released
    after it was discovered that the children were actually small adults.
<br>
When asked why she had taken them into the woods, Fanypants told authorities
"The migdets were creeping me out so I had them follow me into the woods with
 promises of candy and stilts"
 <br>
 "My plan was to take them to the tall weeds and leave them there in hopes they would get lost".
<br>
When asked why, she replyed "Half-stacks are not normal and should be left in the woods".
